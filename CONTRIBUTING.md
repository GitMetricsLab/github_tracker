## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Branching Workflow

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github_tracker.git
   cd github_tracker
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote and sync with the latest main branch:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/GitMetricsLab/github_tracker.git
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout -b <topic-branch> upstream/main
   ```
4. Commit your work to your topic branch and push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <topic-branch>
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request from `<your-username>:<topic-branch>` to `GitMetricsLab:main`.

### Commit Conventions

Use Conventional Commits. Examples:

- `docs(readme): improve setup instructions`
- `fix(auth): handle missing session cookie`
- `feat(tracker): add contributor activity chart`

This helps with change logs and automated releases.

### Sign-offs / DCO (Optional)

If your organization requires a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), add a sign-off to each commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "docs(readme): clarify install steps"
```

### Link Back to Quick Start

For first-time setup and commands, see the Quick Start in `README.md`.

## 🚦 Pull Request Guidelines

### **Split Big Changes into Multiple Commits**
- When making large or complex changes, break them into smaller, logical commits. 
- Each commit should represent a single purpose or unit of change (e.g. refactoring, adding a feature, fixing a bug).
---
- ✅ Ensure your code builds and runs without errors.
- 🧪 Include tests where applicable.
- 💬 Add comments if the logic is non-trivial.
- 📸 Attach screenshots for UI-related changes.
- 🔖 Use meaningful commit messages and titles.

## 🧠 Good Coding Practices

1. **Consistent Style**  
   Stick to the project's linting and formatting conventions (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind classes).

2. **Meaningful Naming**  
   Use self-explanatory names for variables and functions.

3. **Avoid Duplication**  
   Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

4. **Testing**  
   Add unit or integration tests for any new logic.

5. **Review Others’ PRs**  
   Help others by reviewing their PRs too!
