## 🚦 Pull Request Guidelines

### **Split Big Changes into Multiple Commits**
- When making large or complex changes, break them into smaller, logical commits. 
- Each commit should represent a single purpose or unit of change (e.g. refactoring, adding a feature, fixing a bug).
---
- ✅ Ensure your code builds and runs without errors.
- 🧪 Include tests where applicable.
- 💬 Add comments if the logic is non-trivial.
- 📸 Attach screenshots for UI-related changes.
- 🔖 Use meaningful commit messages and titles.

## 🧠 Good Coding Practices

2. **Meaningful Naming**  
   Use self-explanatory names for variables and functions.

3. **Avoid Duplication**  
   Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

4. **Testing**  
   Add unit or integration tests for any new logic.

5. **Review Others’ PRs**  
   Help others by reviewing their PRs too!
